### Description
A CLI database management application. I used SQL as the database and MySQL Workbench as the graphical user interface for managing and interacting with the database. 

### Installation
Run 'npm install' from the root folder. Make sure you have MySQL Workbench along with SQL database installed as well. 

### Usage
Assuming you have SQL and MySQL Workbench installed, follow the beginning of the video in the "assets" folder.

### Contribution
